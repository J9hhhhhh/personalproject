        Sneakers Although everyone owns a pair of sneakers, not many people know
        what their shoes are worth. Many dont even know if their sneakers are
        authentic or unauthorized. There are a wide variety of sneakers which
        holds very different colors and styles, the designs have led to
        popularity in sneakers. The sneaker business has experienced a dramatic
        increase over the last decade due to the rarity and demands of iconic
        sport shoe. Although most shoes are mass produced the sneaker business
        still holds high expectations in the near future. How Popularity Began
        In 1921 Converse released the shoe known as “Chuck Taylor” which started
        the era of iconic basketball shoes. The reason why people loved these
        sneakers so much is due to all the publicity and advertisements the
        shoes received. “Upstart brands like AND 1 or Pony hitched their fates
        to athletes from their launches. In the case of AND 1 and its Thai Chi
        model, it was Vince Carter, who would wow teenage boys everywhere in the
        2000 NBA All-Star Dunk Contest. In 1975, that upstart brand was Pony and
        its new product, the TOPSTAR, which became popular after the company
        snagged the leagues hot newcomers David Thompson and Darryl Dawkins in
        their first season. Now, points out Osborne, “Under Armour is getting
        the first buzz… show more content… If a company were to release only
        about 250 pairs of limited edition Sneakers and there are over 2 million
        consumers who holds interest in the Sneakers then more than likely the
        shoes will hold immense value then other variety of Sneakers.n 1984,
        Nike teamed up with Michael Jordan to launch Jordan Brand, a brand of
        shoes and athletic wear built around the player. At the time, Nike was a
        struggling brand selling running shoes with an idea to reinvent itself
        as a company for athletic stars. Modern sneaker culture had its roots in
        the air; that is, the original Air Jordan that released in 1985. Nike,
        and subsequently the Jordan Brand, has honored this iconic silhouette
        numerous times since with releases of the Retro 1. The Chicago Bulls
        used their third overall draft pick on Jordan, a 1982 NCAA champion who
        would go on to win Olympic gold later in the summer of 1984. Jordan
        signed a five-year endorsement deal with Nike, reportedly worth $2.5
        million (plus royalties), an enormous outlay for an athlete who hadn't
        yet proven himself on the professional level. The NBA banned the
        original Air Jordan for not meeting the league's stringent policy on
        uniforms and colors. Jordan wore them anyway and faced a $5,000-per-game
        fine as a result. Recognizing a unique marketing opportunity when it
        presented itself, Nike happily paid the fine. And MJ rocked them all the
        way to his Rookie of the Year honor.

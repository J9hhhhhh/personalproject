         Stephen Curry dribbled 14 times, toying with defenders
        before bursting forward for a layup. On another, he dived over the first
        row of fans after a loose ball and disappeared like a magician. And
        during one breathtaking stretch of the third quarter, he did what he
        does best — score points in rapid succession — to turn a tight game into
        a blowout. Curry, the Golden State Warriors guard with unique flair for
        the dramatic, did a bit of everything to lead the Warriors to a 118-91
        victory over Oklahoma City in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals on
        Wednesday night. After he made a 26-footer with 5:11 left, the Warriors led,
        79-59.

        OKC (46%) shot a better percentage from 3-point range than did Golden
        State (43%), but the Warriors almost doubled the Thunder in volume — 47
        3-point attempts to 24. Thompson was 6-of-14 from three and Splash
        Brother Stephen Curry was 8-of-14 from three — 12-of-20 overall — in his
        marvelous 38-point
